  ## For Fun

  Node Knockout is for fun. While we applaud a competitive spirt, the
  competition is about spending a weekend with other noders building awesome
  stuff, not winning prizes.

  At the end of the day, try to remember that no matter what happens to your
  score, you’ll still have had a great time, built something awesome, and
  gotten a ton of exposure for your idea.

  ## How Scoring Works

  Entries will be judged on a 1-5 scale across 4 dimensions:

  - **Innovation** - How original is the idea and execution?
  - **Design** - How good does it look and feel to use?
  - **Utility / Fun** - Is the site offering a service I'd use again and again?
  - **Completeness** - How "fully baked" is the site? Are there bugs or dead ends? Does it work in my browser?

  Additionally, a **Popularity** score will be calculated based on the number
  of votes a entry gets from the general public.

  In order to ensure all reviews are [anchored] similarly, we ask that people
  try to [grade along a curve] with a mean of 3.5.

  ## Voting

  All voting will take place between 0:00 UTC on Monday, November 12 and 0:00
  UTC on Sunday, November 18.

  There will be three groups of voters:

  1. **contestants**
  2. **expert judges**
  3. **general public**

  ## Contestants

  Due to the fact that there are many more contestants than judges, we expect
  the majority of voting in this year's Node Knockout to be done by
  contestants voting on each others’ entries.

  In order for contestant scoring to be succesful, we need lots of contestants
  to vote. To encourage this, we will only show contestants the scores for
  teams that they have judged. So if you want to know how your app is doing
  relative to the competition, you will need to vote.

  Contestants should remember that votes are attached to their public GitHub
  profiles. Also, since any contestant can vote on any other contestant's app,
  contestants should try to be as fair and balanced to others as they expect
  others to be to them.

  We reserve the right to disqualify teams from the contest for inappropriate
  or unfair judging behavior (as determined by the organizers).

  Contestants will not be allowed to vote on their own entries (because it
  would give teams with more members an unfair advantage).

  ## Expert Judges

  We have an [amazing and diverse panel of expert judges](/judges) who are
  volunteering their time to provide thoughtful feedback on contestants’
  work.

  Unfortunately, it just isn’t possible to get enough expert judges to ensure
  that every entry gets an adequate number of expert votes. Thus, this year
  **expert judges will only vote on the top entries**.

  Each expert judge will be asked to review an initial batch of 5-10 entries.
  After they do their initial batch, judges will be encouraged to review
  a handful more of the top entries that pique their interest. Experts will
  be asked not to vote for teams who they know.

  The hope is that this will allow all the top entries to get at least 2-3
  thoughtful expert reviews and that the best entries will get enough reviews
  that the [law of large numbers] ensures fairness.

  ## General Public

  General public voters will not score on 4 dimensions, but will instead simply
  vote up the entry. These votes will contribute exclusively to the entry's
  popularity and overall score.

  Any member of the general public will be allowed to vote, but Facebook login
  will be required. You are encouraged to get as many people as possible to
  vote for your work, as these votes form the entrity of the popularity
  component of your team's score.

  ## Calculation

  A team's score will be determined by combining the expert judge score and the
  contestant scores for each dimension along with the popularity component
  derived from each entry's public vote count.

  The overall score will be the average of all 5 components (innovation,
  design, utility / fun, completeness and popularity).

  ## Prizes

  There will be the following 7 prize categories:

  - **Team Overall** - the best overall score for a 2+ person team
  - **Solo Overall** - the best overall score for a one-person team
  - **Innovation** - the highest innovation score
  - **Design** - the highest design score
  - **Utility / Fun** - the highest utility / fun score
  - **Completeness** - the highest completeness score
  - **Popularity** - the entry with the most public votes

  A team may only win one prize and will earn the highest prize (in the above
  rank order) for which it qualifies, opening its spot in the running for lower
  prizes to the next most qualified team.

  See the [prizes page](/prizes) for a list of prizes.

  ## Cheating

  This is a competition for fun. The honor code applies: we're trusting you
  to do the honorable thing.

  We have implemented a number of mechanisms to detect and to eliminate ballot
  stuffing, and we will be have a zero tolerance policy towards cheating.  If
  you are provably caught cheating, you will be disqualified immediately, be
  banned from all future events, and generally be thought of as a bad person by
  all of the organizers and potentially many, many, more people.  Trust us,
  it's not worth the risk.
