  # Rules

  ### Node.js

  All applications must be built using node.js™. This isn't to say you
  can't use additional technology to _supplement_ node.js™, like MongoDB™.

  <h3 id="duration">48 Hours</h3>

  You've got precisely 48 hours to develop your web app during the Knockout,
  not a minute more. The competition kicks off at [12:00 AM / 00:00 UTC on
  November 10, 2012][start time] and ends at [12:00 AM / 00:00 UTC on November
  12, 2012][end time]. Be sure you understand what time that translates to in
  your local time zone.

  Of course, feel free to work on the _concept_ for your application before the
  competition starts: pretty hand-drawn pictures on napkins, angry email
  threads between team members on two-space or four-space indentation, schema
  designs, finite state machines. Just no digital assets including graphic
  design assets, code, etc.

  After those 48 hours are up, judging will ensue. No additional features or
  bug fixes are allowed during judging, or you will be disqualified. Please
  don't make us disqualify you; we'll be very sad.

  <h3 id="teams">Teams and Contestants</h3>

  Teams are comprised of between one to four individuals. No more than four
  people are allowed on a team (and no less than one). To be eligible, teams
  must register at least one week prior to the start of the competition (space
  subject to availability). Individuals don't need to be programmers nor even
  know node.js, but both of those definitely help.

  No worries if you work for a sponsor: they won't be able to influence the
  judging process. Moreover, don't worry if you know a judge either: we'll
  prevent judges from voting on a team they know personally and they're
  committed to stay impartial.

  <h3 id="scm">Source Control</h3>

  Source code will be hosted in a shiny, free git repository provided by
  [GitHub]. We'll send GitHub repo access information before the competition
  starts. Your team should push regularly to show progress. We'll be watching
  to make sure people don't cheat (don't think you can develop everything ahead
  of time and push it all at the end; we know lots of git tricks too).

  <h3 id="deployment">Deployment</h3>

  [nodejitsu] will provide free, private instances to deploy your code to
  during the competition. Expect login information before the competition
  starts.

  In order to ensure that no code is changed during the judging week, all
  contestants must deploy their apps to the [nodejitsu] instances provided
  for the competition. You cannot deploy to any other server, no matter how
  face-meltingly awesome it is.

  Entries will remain up until winners are announced. During judging, we will
  have access to make sure there is no cheating, including comparing deployed
  code with that in the git repo. After the 48-hour deadline, you will still
  be allowed to restart processes, free up disk space, and other general
  sysadmin tasks, including playing lots of StarCraft 2.

  <h3 id="web">Web Application</h3>

  Entries _should_ be web applications. It's hard for judges (especially the
  general public) to fairly evaluate entries that require compilation or setup.
  If you want to submit a non-web app, you're welcome to, but you aren't likely
  to get judged fairly. If an app is not a website, but some library, utility,
  or desktop program, then it must be deployed to the [npm] registry.

  If you do decide to submit something that isn't immediately accessible via
  the web, then we encourage you to think of a clever way to share it as a
  website (e.g. via [VNC]) or market it (e.g. [jQuery Quicksand]).

  <h3 id="technical">Technical Entries</h3>

  If you want to make sure that the expert judges looking at your app have a
  technical background, you'll have an option to label your entry so. We'll
  assign technical judges accordingly, but there are no guarantees that your
  assigned judges will have any given specific expertise. Also, other
  non-technical judges may still be called on to judge your app if technical
  entries greatly outnumber technical judges.

  <h3 id="libraries">Libraries</h3>

  Libraries, plugins, and modules that are public and freely available are
  allowed and encouraged. During judging, please list all libraries that you
  use on your team's profile page to give credit where it's due. Stock photos
  and free icon sets are allowed. Paying for something that is not generally
  available to everyone else is not allowed, and not nice.

  Developing a library in secret before the competition that provides the same
  general functionality of your entry and releasing it a day before will
  likely get you disqualified and called sneaky. On the other hand, developing
  a library that is publicly available and provides a general-purpose, publicly
  usable function can be done before the competition begins.

  <h3 id="services">Web Services</h3>

  We encourage use of third-party web services and their APIs (e.g. Twitter,
  Flickr, Google maps). Almost everyone loves mashups.  Again, make sure to
  update your team profile with what services you use.

  <h3 id="ownership">Ownership and Open Source</h3>

  The code you write is yours. If you intend to share it after the competition,
  you can pick whatever license you love. We encourage contestants to open
  source their code, but it's totally up to you. If you want to start a
  business based on it, awesome.

  Note however, we will have access to your GitHub repository during the
  competition to audit for cheating, but we won't steal any of your secret
  recipes or patent-pending algorithms. Stealing will get us disqualified.

  <h3 id="scoring">Scoring</h3>

  Winners will be picked by a mixture of voting by judges, contestants, and
  the general public. More details are forthcoming.

  <h3 id="misc">Miscellany</h3>

  Don't break any laws. Don't harm any animals (especially [potbellied pigs]).
  Wear sunscreen and have fun. This is all for fun and glory, so don't hurt
  yourself.
